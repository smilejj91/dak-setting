ftpmaster meta package for DSA


This is a dummy package that makes Debian's package management
system believe that certain packages needed for ftpmaster have
to be installed. The intention is that DSA can easily see what
needs to be there.

If you, for whatever reason, need a package added to this meta-
packages dependency list, contact ftpmaster@debian.org, NOT
the Debian admins.
