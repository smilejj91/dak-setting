Description: Meta package for DSA listing ftpmaster needs
 This is a small meta package for the Debian System Administrators
 so DSA easily knows (and can keep installed) all packages
 Ftpmaster needs.
 .
 If, for whatever reason, you need a package added to this ones
 Dependencies, ask ftpmaster, not the Debian admins.
 .
 This is not only "What DAK needs", but a general "FTPMaster needs this
 to do the work"
