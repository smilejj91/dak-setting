ftpmaster-common (1.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Partly revert 1.1, and keep a recommends split. DSA gets another kind of
    package elsewhere, so we can use this as a kind of documentation for new
    setups.

ftpmaster-common (1.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Move recommends into depends. While its true that database might not
    be on the same host, this package *main* usage is as a help for
    DSA. And DSA does not install recommends by default, so make it
    depends. We do want the database stuff, really. :)
