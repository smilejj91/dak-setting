This is a list of problems that I have seen:

 - One an upload failed with the following error:

     Jul  8 12:13:53 Upload to master.debian.org failed, last exit status 1
     Jul  8 12:13:53 Error messages from scp:
     bind: Permission denied
     lost connection

   Never seen such an error from ssh/scp before... But since it didn't
   happen again, I suspect something with master and/or the net.

 - There are some protocol problems between certain ssh version (on
   client/server side). The effect is that scp either hangs itself
   (times out after $remote_timeout), or leaves ssh processes hanging
   around. I've noticed that with ssh 1.2.19 on the server. I have a
   prototype for a workaround, but haven't included it in
   debianqueued, because master has been updated to 1.2.20 now and the
   problem disappeared.

 - The "ftp" method has some limitiations:
   	1) Files in the target dir can't be deleted.
   	2) Uploaded files can't be verified as good as with the other methods.
   	3) $chmod_on_target often doesn't work.
   	4) The check for a writable incoming directory leaves temporary files
   	   behind.
