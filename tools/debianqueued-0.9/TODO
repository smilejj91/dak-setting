 - There are numerous potential portability problems... They'll show
   up as this script is used on more and different machines.

 - There was a suggestion how bad files on uploads could be handled
   easier than with command files: Give them some known extension
   (e.g. .<digits>), and the daemon could look for those files if the
   main file has bad size or md5.

 - Make provisions for the (rare) case that the daemon looks at a
   yet-incomplete .changes file.
